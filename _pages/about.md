An information technology student turned electrical engineering student, trying to learn.
This site is intended as a repository for my projects during my course and my free time. Through my projects, I hope to showcase my skills and abilities.

<strong>NOTE: This site will NOT contain any projects done in any educational institution. The rationale is that I want to focus on my work and capabilities outside of school</strong>
