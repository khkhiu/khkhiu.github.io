An information technology student turned electrical engineering student, trying to learn.
This site is intended as a repository for my projects during my course and my free time. Through my projects, I hope to showcase my skills and abilities.

On a more light hearted note, observe as electrical engineering slowly transform into computer engineering/ computer science. Other subjects may also make an appearance or 2(wink).
