An information technology student turned electrical engineering student, trying to learn.
This site is intended as a repository for my projects during my course and my free time. Through my projects, I hope to showcase my skills and abilities.

<strong>NOTE: The main focus of this site will be my personal projects as I want to showcase my work outside of my educational institutions. However, some of the projects from educational institution will still make an appearance</strong>
