<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
'Digital Electronics 1' introduces students to the knowledge, understanding and design techniques necessary to enable them to design simple combinational circuits using commercial SSI and MSI integrated circuits. Additional topics covered include introduction to simple sequential logic circuits such as flipflops and mono-stables.

'Digital Electronics 2' builds on basic material covered earlier with advanced topics such as adders, multiplexers/ demultiplexers, decoders/ encoders, counters and shift registers and some application examples of these circuits.
