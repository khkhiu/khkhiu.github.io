<strong>Introduction</strong>

***

Programmable logic controller (PLC) are industrial computer systems that are designed to operate reliably in harsh environments. PLC are typically used for task, such as controlling manufacturing processes, machines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis.

<strong>Assigned task</strong>

For this project, we were tasked with coming up with an improvement to an existing solution to better address the problem. 

<strong>I will be reusing my presentation slides to aid me in my explanation of my solution</strong>

|<em>On January 3 2022, Singapore eased covid rules for working in office.</em>|

|![issue](/assets/images/SP-PLC/Slide4.JPG)|
|<em>This means more people dining in at hawker centres and food courts. That many people in close proximity increases the risk of spreading COVID.</em>|

|![solution](/assets/images/SP-PLC/Slide5.JPG)|
|<em>A way to stem the spread is using ready meal vending machines.</em>|

|![solution](/assets/images/SP-PLC/Slide6.JPG)|
|<em>However, ready meal containers are quite hot when coming out of a vending machine.</em>|

|![improvement](/assets/images/SP-PLC/Slide7.JPG)|
|<em>Give customers an option to add an additional container that insulates the heat.
This ready meal will be placed in the container to act as an insulating area.
For customers who want to use their own container, they can place their container onto a conveyor belt.
This convenor will take the container into the machine and will place the ready meal onto the container.</em>|
