**Background information** I am using the book: Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition to teach myself the basics of python. This is a follow up post <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/personal/personal-python-basics/"> Python Basics. </a> For more information on the book, click the following link

Python Crash Course is split into 2 parts. The first part covers the basics of python , which can be found <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/personal/personal-python-basics/"> here </a>. The second part consist of 3 projects.

1. Space shooter with pygame
2. Data Visualisation with Matplotlib and Plotly
3. Web Applications with Django

Even though I am unlikely to go into game development, I am embarking on this project because I think it will be interesting (may or may not attempt a Tetris-esk game in the future, we will see).
