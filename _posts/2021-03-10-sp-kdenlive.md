As part of our final submission for the EDS, our team was tasked with the filming of a demonstration of how our project worked.

Due to the complexity of the project, along with inexperience of the team with filming in general, we opted to record the demonstraion in seperate segments and merging them together during editing.

To achieve this, the team opted to use Kdenlive due to its free and open source nature. (It was also the first result we got when we searched 'FOSS video editor' at the time)
