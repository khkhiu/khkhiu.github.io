**Engineering Design and Solutions(EDS)** Engineering Design Solutions is module where students are tasked with designing a solution for a given problem statement

As part of our final submission for the EDS, our team was tasked with the filming of a demonstration of how our project worked.

Due to the complexity of the project, along with inexperience of the team with filming in general, we opted to record the demonstration in separate segments and merging them together during editing. 

To achieve this, the team opted to use Kdenlive due to its free and open source nature. (It was also the first result we got when we searched 'FOSS video editor' at the time)

**KdenLive** KdenLive is a free and open source video editing software.

We first inserted all the video footage that we recorded into the software.

Due to the interference present on a number of the video clips, some of the voice over had to be re-recorded. This was achieved using audacity. 

**Audacity** Audacity is a free and open audio recording and editing software.

Using the 'ungroup clips' and 'group clips' function in KdenLive, we replaced the original audio with the appropriate voice overs and sound effects. Furthermore, some clips were slowed down to allow better synchronisation with the audio

Our project also incorporated data logging via cloud using the Blynk app. Due to the team's inexperience at the time, we were not able to record our Blynk app in action. As such, we took a screen capture and uploaded that onto KdenLive. We were then able to synchronise the voice over with duration of the image.

Transitions were also added to make the video flow more smoothly.

Lastly, the video was rendered and was subsequently submitted to our lecturer accordingly.
