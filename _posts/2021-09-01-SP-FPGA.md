<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
<strong>Digital Systems Design </strong>introduces students to the world of digital electronic system design. It will cover topics such as PLD, Verilog and the design of Synchronous Sequential Logic. Students will learn about the basic programming logics devices such as PLA, PAL, CPLD and FPGA and design simple logic systems using these devices.

In this assignment, students are required to design and implement a digital system using synchronous sequential logic using finite state machines(FSM) in Verilog on a Basys-3 FPGA board.

<strong>Problem statement</strong>

***
Students are to design a generic Vending machine that will dispense a product of 3 different price points. The block diagram of the Vending machine controller is shown below.

The clock comes from the oscillator of the Basys3 board and has a frequency of 100 MHz.DIP switches are used to select the size of the product to purchase, 3 LEDs are used to show which product is to be dispensed when the correct amount of money is inserted. The 7-segment display is used to show the amount of money inserted. The push buttons are used to input the money into the machine as shown Below. Only denomination of $2, $5 and $10 will be accepted by the machine.

<strong>Operations of the vending machine</strong>

<strong>TASK 1</strong>
Upon power up, the 7-segment device should show “00.0” as the amount of money inserted is zero. LEDs 1,2,3 will be blinking to indicate that all 3 items are available.<strong>ALL OTHER LEDs WILL BE TURNED OFF.</strong>

<strong>TASK 2</strong>
The user selects the product by flipping the relevant DIP switches(Dip switches 1,2,3). Once the product is selected, the selected LEDs will stop blinking.<strong> The 3 assigned LEDs will turn OFF. All other LEDs will be ON.</strong>
