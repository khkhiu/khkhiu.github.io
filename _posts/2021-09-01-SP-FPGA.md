<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
<strong>Digital Systems Design </strong>introduces students to the world of digital electronic system design. It will cover topics such as PLD, Verilog and the design of Synchronous Sequential Logic. Students will learn about the basic programming logics devices such as PLA, PAL, CPLD and FPGA and design simple logic systems using these devices.

In this assignment, students are required to design and implement a digital system using synchronous sequential logic using finite state machines(FSM) in Verilog on a Basys-3 FPGA board.
