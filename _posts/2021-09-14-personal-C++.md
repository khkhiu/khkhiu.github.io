<strong>Introduction</strong>

***

Since I have some time, I figured I should do some revision, starting with C++. To achieve that aim, I will be using the following book: C++ Crash Course, A Fast-Paced Introduction by Josh Lospinoso, published by No Starch Press. The book is split into 2 parts: first, "The C++ core language", second "C++ libraries and frameworks"

Similar to to the post: <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/learning%20process/personal-python-basics/">"Python Basics" </a> this post will also be a summary of various checkpoints entirely because part 1 of the book is 243 pages across 9 chapters and later chapters heavily utilize concepts in earlier chapters.
