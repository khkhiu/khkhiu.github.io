<strong>Task</strong>

***
Similar to <cite><a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/CTF_DSTA-CDDC-2021/">DSTA CDDC 2021</a></cite>, we were given learning material in the form of lecturers and quizzes to help prepare us for the competition. The following images are extracted from the user guide and will help illustrate how the training platform works.

Participants will first complete the 'Gauntlet' challenge, before moving onto 'rings'. Completing challenges in a ring will unlock subsequent rings containing escalating challenges.

<strong>Reflections</strong>

***

This segment will contain the overall reflections for <cite><a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/CTF_DSTA-CDDC-2021/">DSTA CDDC 2021</a></cite>, <cite><a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/CTF_CSA-AYCEP-2021/">CSA - SG Cyber Youth Odyssey - A.YCEP 2021</a></cite> and DSTA CDDC 2021.

My cybersecurity journey thus far has largely been focused on being on the 'Red Team'. However, after the events of <cite><a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/Hackathon_GovTech_Geekout-2022/">GovTech GeekOut 2022</a></cite>, I believe that I would fare a lot better being on the 'Blue Team'. The experience of being on the 'Red Team' would serve me well in securing cloud and other similar infrastructure in the future.
