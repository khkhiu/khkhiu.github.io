<strong>Let’s rethink how we learn and reimagine what education could be </strong>

Socioeconomic well-being of a society is closely hinged on literacy and education level of the society. In the last decades, access to quality and inclusive education were high priority for most countries, and we have witnessed good progress. However, significant gaps remain. Moreover, COVID pushed us back in terms of the progress towards SDG 4. During the pandemic, many children affected by school closures are at risk of never going back to class and at risk of being forced to take up work.

The education landscape has been drastically disrupted in the past one to two years and will continue to evolve rapidly. How can we innovate and leverage technology to help learners adapt, ensure inclusive and quality education for all, and promote lifelong learning, while supporting the well-being of all learners?

<strong>Problem Statements(verbatim)</strong>

***

1. How might we enhance learner's experience (primary 4 – undergraduates) in the virtual environment when adopting blended learning approach? 

2. How might we develop a culture that embraces lifelong learning for the Singapore workforce. The result should be a quantifiable paradigm shift towards habitualising learning? 

3. How might we leverage technology to enable inclusive and accessible lifelong learning opportunities for persons with disabilities?
