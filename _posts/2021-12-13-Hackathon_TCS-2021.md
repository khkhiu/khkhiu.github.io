<strong>Introduction</strong>

***

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a leading global IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization. The TCS Sustainathon is case-challenge competition launched in 2020 aiming to inspire tertiary students to leverage innovation and technology to address sustainability challenges.

<strong>Let’s rethink how we learn and reimagine what education could be </strong>

Socioeconomic well-being of a society is closely hinged on literacy and education level of the society. In the last decades, access to quality and inclusive education were high priority for most countries, and we have witnessed good progress. However, significant gaps remain. Moreover, COVID pushed us back in terms of the progress towards SDG 4. During the pandemic, many children affected by school closures are at risk of never going back to class and at risk of being forced to take up work.

The education landscape has been drastically disrupted in the past one to two years and will continue to evolve rapidly. How can we innovate and leverage technology to help learners adapt, ensure inclusive and quality education for all, and promote lifelong learning, while supporting the well-being of all learners?

<strong>Problem Statements(verbatim)</strong>

***

1. How might we enhance learner's experience (primary 4 – undergraduates) in the virtual environment when adopting blended learning approach? 

2. How might we develop a culture that embraces lifelong learning for the Singapore workforce. The result should be a quantifiable paradigm shift towards habitualising learning? 

3. How might we leverage technology to enable inclusive and accessible lifelong learning opportunities for persons with disabilities?

<strong>Proposed Solution</strong>

***

Due to time constraints, I opted to tackle Problem Statement 2 as I could modify one of my old hackathon solutions to fit the purpose.

The proposed solution is split into 2 parts, namely:
1. Frontend
2. Backend

<strong>Frontend</strong>

The front end is a modified version of the chatbot used in <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/Hackathon_MindFullHacks-2021/"> MindfulHacks Hackathon, 2021  </a>. The primary difference between the 2 chatbot is that the MindFullHacks chatbot focused on mental health, while this chatbot aimed to be a virtual trainer.

The idea is to allow users to speak to the chatbot and have it respond to user speech in turn. This allows of a more personal and 'human' learning experience compared to other text based online learning platform.

The solution was created using the following core technologies
1. AWS Sumerian, to create the virtual trainer and background
2. AWS Polly, which turns text to speech
3. AWS Lex, allows for building the response of the chatbot
4. AWS Lambda, which controls the behaviour of the trainer
5. AWS Cognito, which manages user accounts.
6. AWS DynamoDD, used to store training material

Here is a video demonstration of the chatbot:

      allowfullscreen="">
  </iframe>
</div>

<strong>Backend</strong>

The Backend contains machine learning and data analytics tools. AWS SageMaker is used to implement machine learning models that allows for the trainer to determine which training material to show the user. Thus allowing the user to learn at pace that best suits them.

AWS Athena and AWS QuickSight are used to generate and present data analytics to the parent organisation. Thus allowing for the parent organisation to implement changes and improvements to their training material.

<strong>Backend</strong>

Below is a rough flowchart of the technology involved in the solution:

<strong>Closing thoughts:</strong>

***
Echoing sentiments present in <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/Hackathon_MindFullHacks-2021/"> MindfulHacks Hackathon, 2021  </a>, this is probably the last time I use AWS Sumerian in a hackathon or personal project as I explore other fields.
