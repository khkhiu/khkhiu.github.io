In an interesting turn of events, assignment 2 requires us to design a smartphone holder using Fusion 360. Unlike assignment 1, where the designs were intended to be 3d printed, assignment 2 was intended to be laser cut instead. However due to COVID19, we only had to design and did not get to physically make the items.

***

<strong>Introductions and Concept Design</strong>

***
According to the assignment, the smartphone holder must fit the following criteria:
- Must not exceed 150mm by 150mm by 150mm
- Must contain our names, class and student ID
- Must be made of at least 3 parts

With this I mind, I decided that my design will consist of the following
1. A square shaped base to ensure stability
2. A support structure that leans backwards to prevent the phone from falling over.
3. A hole for a charging cable to pass through

With this in mind, this was what the final product looks like:

<strong>General design notes</strong>

***

The entire structure was created using sketch and extrude commands. The holder uses mortise and tenon joints to allow for all component to be connected together. The exception are the front support joints, which uses dovetail joints for connection

The modify:align command was used to stager the joints of the rear support while ensuring that they were equidistant from each other.

Joints were manually extruded  The general assembly was done by manually moving the pieces into place and using the modify:combine:cut command to make the holes that the parts will be slotted in. The slots were then extruded slightly to allow for some leeway to during final assembly. Some of the joints were also extended for the same purpose.

The command sketch:create:slot was used on the support structures to create holes that allows a charging cable to pass through.

<strong>Laser cut layout</strong>

***
A copy of the assembled design file was saved. All parts were subsequently disassembled and laid flat.

Next, a new base of 150mm by 150mm by 3mm was drawn and extruded.

Lastly, the combine:cut command was used to 'cut' the new base.

Both files were then exported and submitted accordingly.
