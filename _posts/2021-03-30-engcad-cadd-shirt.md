Revision of Fusion 360 and 3D CADD techniques

***

We spent quite some time revising the use of Fusion 360 and various CADD techniques. I recognise that this an attempt by the staff to ensure that all students have a similar foundation in CADD know-how. With this in mind, here are the designs that we did over the course of the 2 day session.

<strong>Name tag</strong>

![engcad nametag final](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_nametag.png)
<em>The final name tag design</em>

The overall design was achieved using create: sketch and created: extrude. The edges were smoothed using modify: fillet.

The following table will go through some aspects of the design of the name tag.

| Notes on design | Image |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|The key ring joint was created using a construction line and create: arc. The ring itself was made using create: 2 point circle and create: centre diameter circle. |![engcad nametag build 1](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_nametag_build1.png)|
|The overall structure was extruded and hollowed using modify: shell|![engcad nametag build 2](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_nametag_build2.png)|

<strong>The Rook and the fidget spinner shell</strong>

The rook and fidget spinner are group together as both are related to 'games' for lack of a better term.

<strong>The screws and bolts</strong>

We also practice creating screws and bolts. The rationale behind this was so that we know how to design and 3D print our own screws and bolts in the future.

![engcad screw and bolt complete](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_bolt_screw_complete.png)<em>m3 screw and bolt</em>

The general structure of the bolts and screws were created using create: sketch and create: extrude. However, there are some unique aspects of the designs that will be covered in the following table.

| Modeling the parts | Image |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The threads of the screw was created using create: thread| ![engcad m3 screw](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_m3.png)<em>threads made using m3 dimensions</em>|
| The hole of the bolt was first created using create: hole. The threads were formed using create: thread| ![engcad bolt hole](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_bolt1.png)<em>creating a hole for threads</em> <br> ![engcad bolt thread](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_bolt2.png)<em>trying out different thread options</em>|

<strong>The Translucent Box</strong>

The translucent box was constructed with all previously described methods with a few notable addition.

T-shirt printing

***
As part of the introductory session, we were also taught the basics of T-shirt printing. For this session, we used a heat press technique.

![engcad shirt](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/shirt-machine.jpeg)
<em>the press machine used to press the image</em>

![engcad logo](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_logo.png)
<em>the Engineering Academy logo</em>

The pressing process is simple

1. Export the design as an SVG file

2. Upload to the terminal connected to the printer and print the design

3. Press the shirt for about 5 seconds to iron the shirt.

4. Align and attach the printed design onto the ironed shirt using heat resistant type.

5. Place the shirt onto the machine along with a protective layer to prevent the ink from staining the machine

6. Press the machine down for about 45 seconds

7. Remove the shirt and print design quickly to prevent smudging

This was the final result of the print.
![engcad shirt](/assets/images/common/Placeholder.png)
<em>The colour looks a little fadded, but I liked the way it turned out</em>

After this we were supposed to add our own designs to the shirt. However, I prefer my shirts to have as simple a design as possible, therefore, I will just leave the shirt as is. Furthermore, after previous experiences with graphic design, I would rather not do any graphic design (although this may change int he future).
