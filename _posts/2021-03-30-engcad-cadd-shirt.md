Revision of Fusion 360 and 3D CADD techniques

***

We spent quite some time revising the use of Fusion 360 and various CADD techniques. I recognise that this an attempt by the staff to ensure that all students have a similar foundation in CADD know-how. With this in mind, here are the designs that we did over the course of the 2 day session.

<strong>Name tag</strong>

<em>The final name tag design</em>

The overall design was achieved using create:sketch and created:extrude. The edges were smoothed using modify:fillet.

| Notes on design | Image |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|The key ring joint was created using a construction line and create: arc. The ring itself was made using create: 2 point circle and create: centre diameter circle. |![engcad nametag build 1](/assets/images/2021-03-29-engcad-cadd-shirt/EA_nametag_build1.png)|

T-shirt printing

***
As part of the introductory session, we were also taught the basics of T-shirt printing. For this session, we used a heat press technique.

<em>the press machine used to press the image</em>

The pressing process is simple

1. Export the design as an SVG file

2. Upload to the terminal connected to the printer and print the design

3. Press the shirt for about 5 seconds to iron the shirt.

4. Align and attach the printed design onto the ironed shirt using heat resistant type.

5. Place the shirt onto the machine along with a protective layer to prevent the ink from staining the machine

6. Press the machine down for about 45 seconds

7. Remove the shirt and print design quickly to prevent smudging

This was the final result of the print.

<em>The colour looks a little fadded, but I liked the way it turned out</em>

After this we were supposed to add our own designs to the shirt. Personally, I prefer my shirts to have as simple a design as possible, therefore, I will just leave the shirt as is.
