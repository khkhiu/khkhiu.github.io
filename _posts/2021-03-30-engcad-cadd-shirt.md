T-shirt printing

***
As part of the introductory session, we were also taught the basics of T-shirt printing. For this session, we used a heat press technique.

The pressing process is simple

1. Export the design as an SVG file

2. Upload to the terminal connected to the printer and print the design

3. Press the shirt for about 5 seconds to iron the shirt.

4. Align and attach the printed design onto the ironed shirt using heat resistant type.

5. Place the shirt onto the machine along with a protective layer to prevent the ink from staining the machine

6. Press the machine down for about 45 seconds

7. Remove the shirt and print design quickly to prevent smudging

This was the final result of the print.

After this we were supposed to add our own designs to the shirt. Personally, I prefer my shirts to have as simple a design as possible, therefore, I will just leave the shirt as is.
