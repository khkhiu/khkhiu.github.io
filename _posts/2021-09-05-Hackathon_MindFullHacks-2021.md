<strong>Introduction and problem statement(verbatim)</strong>

***
MindfulHacks was founded as Singapore's first Mental Health-themed Student Hackathon. It is a 24-hour overnight hackathon where attendees work to build a software project that addresses mental health issues. Our mission is to encourage students to come together and innovate solutions to mental health issues and combat the stigma of mental illness. We welcome students from Universities, Polytechnics, ITEs, and Junior Colleges.

<strong>Problem Statement: Create a tool that will address a specific or multiple mental health issues in your community, whether you want to design and develop an app, create a data visualisation or anything else you can think of!</strong>

<strong>Function of application</strong>

***
The idea is to create a virtual therapist that is available on demand. This would not only make mental health support more accessible by the general public, it can also reduce the stigma around mental health as people can try therapy for themselves without fear of judgement or any monetary or time commitments.

The solution was created using the following core technologies
1. AWS Sumerian, to create the virtual therapist and environment
2. AWS Polly, which turns text to speech
3. AWS Lex, allows for building the response of the chatbot

The chat is a proof of concept and hence has very little functionality as I do not have access to the data needed to implement any machine learning functions.

A user can speak directly to the chat-bot, thus giving it a more life-like feel compared to text based chatbot.

<strong>Challenges faced</strong>

***

1. Getting the lighting source into the desired position was a bit tricky

2. Programming the chat-bot to feel like natural speech was also another issue

3. The chat-bot did not respond to speech using push-to-talk initially(incidentally, I am still not sure what the issue is as it started working out of the blue)

<strong>Closing thoughts:</strong>

While I am highly like going to continue with AWS and cloud computing, this and <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/Hackathon_SMU-LIT-Hackathon-2021/"> SMU-LIT Hackathon 2021. </a> will most likely be the only times that AWS Sumerian will be deployed for the time being as I focus on other fields. Although this makes me wonder if a similar solution can be deployed more effectively using Unreal Engine or Unity Engine.
