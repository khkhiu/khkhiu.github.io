Continued from part 1: <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/singapore%20polytechnic/sp-cadd-3d-pt1/">Computer Aided Drafting - 3D, part 1</a>

As per the stipulated requirements, my desk organiser has the following functions:
- Key chain integrated to the front of the design
- Phone holder at the front
- 4 silos for pens and similar objects 
- 2 deep rectangular compartments for miscellaneous items
- 1 shallow rectangular compartment for erasers

Design thoughts and process: Phone compartment

***

The key chain was first imported into a new file to allow easier visualisation for integration

The idea of the phone holder was an attempt by me to do something that I believe would be unique.

The structure of the phone holder was created using the create box command with the dimensions of 100mm by 30mm by 120mm

The structure was then extruded to make a platform to hold the phone. A hole was subsequently created with the hole command to allow for a charging cable to inserted into the phone holder. The edges were also filleted

Design thoughts and process: Key chain integration

***
An 'L' shaped structure was created using sketch and extrude commands to allow for accommodation of the key chain. The idea behind the 'L' shape was to give a compartment for keys to be placed. This structure was then hollowed and trimmed.

The key chain was then moved into the compartment. The extrude commands was then used to 'encase' the key chain. The cut command was used to further refine the integration of the key chain with the desk organiser.Lastly, a segment of the structure was the extruded to make a compartment for the keys

Design thoughts and process: Stationary compartment

***
A new body at the back of the was created using the modify:press pull and modify:shell commands. The modify: press pull command was used again to raise the base of the middle structure of the 3 small rectangles.

The create:cylinder command along with the modify:shell command was used to create the cylinders meant to accommodate pens.

Lastly, dimension measurements were added as indicated in the submission requirements before being exported and submitted.
