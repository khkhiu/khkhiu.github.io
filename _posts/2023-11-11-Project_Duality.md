## Introduction
Inspired by [OSSU's Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), this is my attempt at creating a self-taught education in Science and the Humanities. The 'Science' portion will focus on principles of their respective scientific fields. Computing related courses will be hosted on [MOOC](https://github.com/khkhiu/MOOC) repository. The 'Humanities' portion will focus on Philosophy, Politics, Economics and History, with a few other fields sprinkled throughout.


## Curriculum-Science

### Physics and Astronomy

Physics and astronomy courses explore the dynamics of matter in motion and the nature of planets, stars, moons, and asteroids. Subtopics include the
study of astrophysics, the history of the universe, and applied and theoretical physics.

**Topics covered**:
`Physics`
`Space`
