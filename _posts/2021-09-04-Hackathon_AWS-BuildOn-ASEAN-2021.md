<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Build On, ASEAN is a competitive hackathon that challenges the community to create technological initiatives and solutions to address challenges faced by participating sponsors.

<strong>The team</strong>

***
The team I was in,<strong>AWS_IDV_DESC</strong>consisted of the following members from Singapore Polytechnic(SP). The name is a reference to the name of my previous team. For more information on that, see here: <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/competition/Hackathon_AWS-BuildOn-ASEAN-2020/"> AWS - BuildOn ASEAN, 2020. </a>

<strong>Problem statement</strong>

***
<strong>AI for Predicting Complications in Chronic Diseases</strong> Hyperglycaemia (diabetes), Hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol), and Hypertension (high blood
pressure) are three of the top chronic diseases that affect Singaporeans. Some of the major
complications for these diseases include cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and eye/foot problems.
Understanding which patients will develop major complications can allow for early diagnosis and
interventions to manage the complications and even prevent the development of complications.
Challenge: To predict the time to developing complications in patients with type 2 diabetes or
hypertension or hyperlipidaemia from the time of first diagnosis. You will be provided with a dataset
that includes patient demographics, information on hospital visits, lab test results, medication, and
diagnoses.

<strong>Significance of problem</strong>

***
According to the Ministry of Health (MOH) and related organizations, there is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases in Singapore. Approximately 1 in 4 Singaporeans aged 40 and above reporting at least 1 chronic disease [1] and roughly 37% of those aged 60 and above reporting 3 or more chronic health conditions in 2017, up from 20% in 2009.[2] There are 2 primary reasons cited for this rise, firstly, greater health awareness resulting in a rise in the number of people willing to be tested and treated. Secondly, an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and an imbalance in diet. This is further corroborated by a study called: The Burden of Disease in Singapore, 1990–2017, commissioned by MOH which stated that dietary risk is the leading risk factor in increasing the years of healthy life lost to premature death and disability in Singapore as of 2017.[3]

Based on current estimations, 1 in 4 people in Singapore will be over the age of 65 by 2030[2]. Coupled with the increasing percentage of the population reporting chronic health issues would place a significant strain on the healthcare system in Singapore. Therefore, the National University Health System (NUHS) saw fit to design an AI system that can predict complications in Chronic Diseases, thereby allowing for early intervention and even prevention.

<strong>Solutions Introduction </strong>

***
The team proposes a cloud-based artificial intelligence system that will predict possible complications in patients with chronic illnesses and time to develop said chronic illnesses based on the patient profile. 
Being cloud based will allow the solution to be easily access by all institution, like hospitals and MOH, that requires it. The system will continually improve itself as more data becomes available, thus improving its accuracy and capabilities.

<strong>Impact of Solution  </strong>

***
The solution can positively impact the target audience and society in a multifaceted manner.

Firstly, the patients at hand. By giving the patients a rough estimate of the possible complications and the time to develop, we allow for more effective early diagnosis intervention or even prevention if applicable. This would improve the overall quality of life of the patient by firstly, reducing their years lived with disabilities (YLDs). [3] Secondly, by halting the progression of an illness, like Hyperlipidemia, at its early stages, we allow the patient and easier time managing their illness as it has not progressed to be more difficult to manage. For illustration, early issues like fatigue and headaches are far easier to manage compared to potential cardiovascular disease in later stages in a Hyperglycemia patient.

Secondly, the medical system. From 2012 to 2017 healthcare spending increased by about 11% a year, rising from about $13 billion to $22 billion. [4] Aging population has been cited as one of the key instigators in for this increase. By allowing for early intervention of chronic illnesses, we can prevent progression of the illness, thus reducing the need for costly medical procedures for more advanced stages of the said illnesses, which are as high as 75% in places like the United States.[5][6]

Based on the team’s research there is a wide spectrum of medical solutions that make use of artificial intelligence and other similar technologies. Examples of such technologies include Project InnerEye by Microsoft that uses AI for medical imaging and Pfizer that uses IBM Watson for immune-oncology research. However, the company we will focus on is KenSci. 

KenSci is a company that developed and AI platform that uses data to improve healthcare with 3 primary solutions. The first solution is called: Providers, which aims to improve the inpatient experience. The second solution is called: Health Plan, which aims to help doctors build and deploy health care and insurance policies. The third solution is called: Medical Devices, which aims to optimize the deployment of medical equipment and resources.[7]

The primary advantage our solution has over KenSci is that our solution focuses on prevention, whereas KenSci focuses on cure and remedy. By allow for early intervention with the growth of chronic illnesses, our solution can address the issues before it can escalate further, thereby reducing the need for cure entirely.
