<strong>Problem statement</strong>

***
<strong>AI for Predicting Complications in Chronic Diseases</strong> Hyperglycaemia (diabetes), Hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol), and Hypertension (high blood
pressure) are three of the top chronic diseases that affect Singaporeans. Some of the major
complications for these diseases include cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and eye/foot problems.
Understanding which patients will develop major complications can allow for early diagnosis and
interventions to manage the complications and even prevent the development of complications.
Challenge: To predict the time to developing complications in patients with type 2 diabetes or
hypertension or hyperlipidaemia from the time of first diagnosis. You will be provided with a dataset
that includes patient demographics, information on hospital visits, lab test results, medication, and
diagnoses.
