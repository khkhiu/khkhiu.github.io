<strong>Introductions</strong>

***

GeekOut is boot-camp and hackathon organized by GovTech that allows students to gain practical experience through technical workshops and apply them to solve real-world problems. Students also experience mentorship under GovTech’s engineers and gain opportunities to network with GovTech’s leaders.

<strong>The event</strong>

***

Taking place from 13 to 17 June, a series of workshops were conducted before culminating in the hackathon presentation on the final day.

<strong>The hackathon</strong>

|<em>problem statement</em>|

The team decided to create 'Trivago for assistive technologies'. The idea is to create a web application that use a machine learning algorithm to better match users to assistive technologies that would best suit them, based on their medical profile.

These profiles will be created using medical data from Singpass and Healthbuddy.

<strong>Frontend</strong>

This is the intended frontend of the proposed web application. Amplify allows developers to quickly build full-stack web applications on AWS. This is where Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA), a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities can also be added here to improve accessibility. Cognito and Singpass work together to authenticate user identities. Lambda host the platform, supported by API Gateway and DynamoDB

<strong>Backend</strong>

Medical information is considered sensitive, and people would want assurance that their data is in good hands. Healthlake will be used to ensure compliance with medical regulations while performing data cleaning. Thus allowing us to use machine learning to generate data while respecting the user's privacy

**Note** The team created a figma mockup of the project. However, this post only details the cloud infrastructure as this is the aspect of the project that I am the most familiar with.

<strong>Reflections</strong>

***

This was the most enjoyable hackathon I have taken part in thus far. This is entirely due to the fact that it was a physical event rather than a virtual one. Being a physical event allowed interact an engage with other participants more easily, allowing us to learn from each other more effectively.

Another take away was in cybersecurity. This was my first experience being on the 'blue team' and found it more intuitive than being on the 'red team'. This has led me to attempt to approach cybersecurity from an infrastructural perspective instead of writing the field off as not being for me.
