<strong>Task</strong>

We were given access to training materials hosted on <a href="https://www.cyberassembly.co/">cyber assembly</a> from 28 May to 20 June to help prepare us for competition.

The competition was supposed to take place from 23 June 1000 to 25 June 1000. However, due to a backend issue, it was rescheduled to 23 June 1900 to 25 June 1900.

<strong>Reflections</strong>

***

Sadly, due to scheduling conflicts, overall lack of experience and knowledge, my team and I were unable to capture many flags. However, despite not being very successful in the competition itself, I still walked away from the event learning more about cybersecurity in general.
