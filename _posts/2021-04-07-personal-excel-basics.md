Introductions

***

Excel is a powerful tool that is used in almost every industry. As such. I believe it is appropriate that I learn a thing or 2 that I am almost guaranteed to be using sometime in the future. 

For this brief introduction, I will be using the following video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNGqeCcTu0Q">
Microsoft Excel Tutorial: 3-Hour MS Excel 2019 Course for Beginners!<a> <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-3e3hAUhDV2lwcoQGD2grg">by the channel: Simon Sez IT </a>.

Creating Basic Formulas in Excel - 29:06

The first 30 minutes of the video goes through various aspects of the interface of Excel 2019, hence I will be skipping ahead.

| Action and Command     | Image |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Addition<br><br>Use: <strong>+</strong>|![add](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/add.png)<br><br>![add op](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/add_op.png)<br><em>addition output</em>|
| Subtraction<br><br>Use: <strong>-</strong>|![minus](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/minus.png)<br><br>![minus op](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/minus_op.png)<br><em>subtraction output</em>|
| Multiplication<br><br>Use: <strong>*</strong>|![multiply](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/multi.png)<br><br>![multiply op](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/multi_op.png)<br><em>multiply output</em>|
| Division<br><br>Use: <strong>/</strong>|![divide](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/divide.png)<br><br>![divide op](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/divide_op.png)<br><em>division output</em>|
| Power<br><br>Use: <strong>^</strong>|![power](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/pwr.png)<br><br>![power op](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/pwr_op.png)<br><em>power output</em>|
| Precedent<br><br>Use: <strong>( )</strong>|![precedent](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/precedent.png)<br><br>![precedent op](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/precedent_op.png)<br><em>precedent output</em>|
|<em>All formula must have an '=' at the front</em>| |

Using the fill handle and dragging across cells, Excel will automatically fill in blanks will associated formulas. This is called relative reference and allows us to quickly auto-fill cells with desired formulas. However, there will be times where will do not want this to occur. How this will achieved will be covered later

|![relative reference](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/rel_ref-1.png)<br><em>relative reference</em>|![relative reference op](/assets/images/personal-excel-basics/rel_ref-2.png)<br><em>relative reference output</em>|
