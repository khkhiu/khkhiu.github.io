**KNIME** KNIME is a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform that integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining "Lego of Analytics" concept . A graphical user interface and use of JDBC allows assembly of nodes combining different data sources, including preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling, data analysis and visualization without, or with only minimal, programming.

<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
Statistics and Analytics for Engineers(SAE) is module that introduces student to statistic and data analytics concepts to solve problems encountered through the course of their studies. One of the ways that this is achieved is through the project detailed in this post.

<strong>All data used is dummy data provided by Singapore Polytechnic(SP) for educational purposes</strong>

<strong>The team</strong>

***
My team consisted of the following people, all of us were from Singapore Polytechnic(SP) taking Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering(DEEE)

1. Khiu Kim Hong
2. Ngo Bing Han
3. Bryan Ng Xu hen

<strong>Problem statement</strong>

***
Student performance monitoring has been one of the crucial KPI in educational institutions. If these institutions are able to foresee any students more likely to be at-risk (do badly in exams), lecturers can do an intervention program prior to the exams. There are several attributes being collected and decided to do something useful with these data.  

Your task is to develop a predictive model on who is likely to be at-risk (do badly in exams) and requires extra support. This model should provide an indication if similar pattern was seen for future students; the model should flag out the record and intervention program should be undertaken.

<strong>1. Business understanding</strong> 

The educational institution wants to be able to predict which students are most likely to be ‘at-risk’ and require assistance.
The attribute that the team will focus on is ‘Target score’. The rationale behind the choice is 2-fold. Firstly, the team believes that ‘Target score’ is a good indication of a student's performance as it is the aggregate of all a student’s subject scores. Secondly, as ‘Target score’ is recorded at the year of the school year, the team believes that enough time has passed for students to acclimatize to the educational institution and hence a student’s performance should not be heavily affected by transitory issues.

<strong>2. Data understanding and preparation.</strong> 
The following table illustrates how the data was cleaned and the rationale behind each step along with the respective nodes used in knime.
