**KNIME** KNIME is a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform that integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining "Lego of Analytics" concept . A graphical user interface and use of JDBC allows assembly of nodes combining different data sources, including preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling, data analysis and visualization without, or with only minimal, programming.

<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
Statistics and Analytics for Engineers(SAE) is module that introduces student to statistic and data analytics concepts to solve problems encountered through the course of their studies. One of the ways that this is achieved is through the project detailed in this post.

<strong>All data used is dummy data provided by Singapore Polytechnic(SP) for educational purposes</strong>

<strong>Problem statement</strong>

***
Student performance monitoring has been one of the crucial KPI in educational institutions. If these institutions are able to foresee any students more likely to be at-risk (do badly in exams), lecturers can do an intervention program prior to the exams. There are several attributes being collected and decided to do something useful with these data.  

Your task is to develop a predictive model on who is likely to be at-risk (do badly in exams) and requires extra support. This model should provide an indication if similar pattern was seen for future students; the model should flag out the record and intervention program should be undertaken.

<strong>1. Business understanding</strong> 

The educational institution wants to be able to predict which students are most likely to be ‘at-risk’ and require assistance.
The attribute that the team will focus on is ‘Target score’. The rationale behind the choice is 2-fold. Firstly, the team believes that ‘Target score’ is a good indication of a student's performance as it is the aggregate of all a student’s subject scores. Secondly, as ‘Target score’ is recorded at the year of the school year, the team believes that enough time has passed for students to acclimatize to the educational institution and hence a student’s performance should not be heavily affected by transitory issues.

<strong>2. Data understanding and preparation</strong> 

The following table illustrates how the data was cleaned and the rationale behind each step along with the respective nodes used in knime.

| :---        | :---        | :---        |
|1|File Reader|Imported CSV into KNIME for analytics|
|1A|Statistics|To obtain a general overview of data and determine which attribute has missing values.|
|2|String Manipulation|‘Gender’ is standardised to ‘M’ and ‘F’ from ‘Male’, ‘Female’, ‘M’ and ’F’.|
|3|Columns Rename|‘Entrance test’, ‘Eng point’, ‘Math point’ and ‘CCA point’ are renamed to ‘Entrance Test Score’, ‘Entrance Eng Score’, ‘Entrance Math Score’ and ‘Entrance CCA point’ respectively to make their affiliation to the entrance test clearer.<br><br>All attributes with ‘Att’ are standardised to ‘att’. All ‘?’ are removed.<br><br>‘Programming subject score’ is changed from integer to double data type for standardisation purposes.|
|4|Rule Engine|1 instance of “Not reported” Annual household income level was replaced with “High”.<br><br>The team believes that this was caused by human error and replaces the unknown value with the mode of the category.|
|5|Column Filter|‘Min. subject score’ is dropped due to redundancy with ‘Overall first sem. score’. “Student ID” is dropped as it is deemed irrelevant.|
|6|Missing Value|The following attributes with missing categorical data need to be filled with their respective modes: ‘Internet’, ‘Romance’.<br><br>The team set the missing value threshold at 5%, as both values are above 5% neither are filtered.|
|7A|Row Filter,<br><br>Reference Row filter|82 students who did not take science subjects are filtered and examined separately.<br><br>The information of these 82 students were filtered into their own separate branch (See 7B).|
|7B|Row Filter,<br><br>Reference Row filter,<br><br>Column filter|As these students do not take science, both science related columns are dropped entirely.|
|8|Rule Engine, Missing Value, Reference Row filter|The 21 rows in ‘Science Subject Attendance’ with a value of 0 are replaced with the median value of ‘Science Subject Attendance’. The value of zero is likely human error and hence should be rectified. Median is selected as the spread of values are heavily positively skewed.|
|9|Colour Manger|Used to set colours to make the graph easier to read|
|10|String Manipulation|Added ‘Disc’ to Discipline, ’Int’ to Internet, ‘RO’ to Romance, ‘PT’ to ‘Part-time, ‘InC’ to ‘Income’ and ‘CON’ to ‘Conduct’ responses to better fit the sunburst chart. <br><br>Separate nodes are needed as different columns are being appended.|

<strong>3.Data exploration</strong> 

Of the 314 students whose data we analysed, 82 of them did not take science as a subject, hence these records of these students are filtered and analysed separately. The students taking science will henceforth be referred to as Group 1 and those not taking science be referred to as Group 2. The team created a histogram of the ‘Target score’ using a numeric binner. ‘Target score’ was binned into increments of 5 for ranges: 60 to 80. Bins for ‘60 and below’ and ‘80 and above’ was also created

|![histogram group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_Hist_G1.png)|![histogram group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_Hist_G2.png)|
|<em>Histogram for group 1</em>|<em>Histogram for group 2</em>|

The histogram of both groups are negatively skewed, indicating that students generally did well for their first semester with the majority getting between 75 to 85 marks. The histograms also show us roughly how many students are performing poorly and resources can be provisioned accordingly.

The team hypothesized that the following factors have an impact on student performance and investigated accordingly.
-	Entrance scores have an impact on performance
-	Students' attendance has an impact on performance
-	Extraneous factors have an impact on student performance

<strong>Entrance scores have an impact on performance.</strong>

Using parallel plots, the team outlined the entrance scores to the ‘Target score’ of both groups of students. It is important to note that lower entrance score equates to better performance, while higher ‘Target score’ indicates better performance.

|![entrance group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_para_G1.png)|![entrance group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_para_G2.png)|
|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-1</em>|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-2</em>|

As seen from the parallel coordinates of both groups, in general students with good entrance scores will continue to do well, and vice versa, barring outliers. Therefore, the team concludes that entrance score is a factor that determines a students’ 1st semester score.

<strong>Attendance has an impact on performance.</strong>
Secondly, using parallel coordinates, the team charted the overall attendance to the ‘Target score’ of both groups of students.

|![attendance group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_att_para_G1.png)|![attendance group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_att_para_G2.png)|
|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-1</em>|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-2</em>|

As shown by both graphs, students of both groups with a small range of attendance yielded a large range of grades. This implies that attendance does not have a strong correlation with performance. As such, we can conclude that attendance does not have a strong impact on performance.

<strong>Extraneous factors have an impact on performance.</strong>

Lastly, using a sunburst and conditional box plot, the team investigated if extraneous factors have any effects on student performance. The team defines extraneous factors as circumstances not directly related to academics. As such, the following attributes are considered extraneous factors: ‘Annual Household Income level’, ‘Part Time Job?’, ‘Internet?’, ‘Conduct in class’, ‘Disciplinary warning’, ‘Romance?’.

|![sunburst group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_sun_G1.png)|![sunburst group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_sun_G2.png)|
|<em>Sunburst chart of Group-1</em>|<em>Sunburst chart of Group-2</em>|

The sunburst chart is intended to give a quick overview of the demographics of Group 1 and Group 2.
For both groups, most of the students are from a high-income household, do not have a discipline record, have internet access, are not involved in a romantic relationship, do not have a part time job and have either ‘good’ or ‘very good conduct’.
Next, we will analyse each of the extraneous factors one by one to see if it affects student performance and see if it relates to the sunburst chart.
