**KNIME** KNIME is a free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform that integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining "Lego of Analytics" concept . A graphical user interface and use of JDBC allows assembly of nodes combining different data sources, including preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling, data analysis and visualization without, or with only minimal, programming.

<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
Statistics and Analytics for Engineers(SAE) is module that introduces student to statistic and data analytics concepts to solve problems encountered through the course of their studies. One of the ways that this is achieved is through the project detailed in this post.

<strong>All data used is dummy data provided by Singapore Polytechnic(SP) for educational purposes</strong>

<strong>Problem statement</strong>

***
Student performance monitoring has been one of the crucial KPI in educational institutions. If these institutions are able to foresee any students more likely to be at-risk (do badly in exams), lecturers can do an intervention program prior to the exams. There are several attributes being collected and decided to do something useful with these data.  

Your task is to develop a predictive model on who is likely to be at-risk (do badly in exams) and requires extra support. This model should provide an indication if similar pattern was seen for future students; the model should flag out the record and intervention program should be undertaken.

<strong>1. Business understanding</strong> 

**Context** "Target score" refers to the final score a student obtain at the final stage of the whole course.
{: .notice--info}

The educational institution wants to be able to predict which students are most likely to be ‘at-risk’ and require assistance.
The attribute that the team will focus on is ‘Target score’. The rationale behind the choice is 2-fold. Firstly, the team believes that ‘Target score’ is a good indication of a student's performance as it is the aggregate of all a student’s subject scores. Secondly, as ‘Target score’ is recorded at the year of the school year, the team believes that enough time has passed for students to acclimatize to the educational institution and hence a student’s performance should not be heavily affected by transitory issues.

<strong>2. Data understanding and preparation</strong> 

The following table illustrates how the data was cleaned and the rationale behind each step along with the respective nodes used in knime.

<strong>3.Data exploration</strong> 

Of the 314 students whose data we analysed, 82 of them did not take science as a subject, hence these records of these students are filtered and analysed separately. The students taking science will henceforth be referred to as Group 1 and those not taking science be referred to as Group 2. The team created a histogram of the ‘Target score’ using a numeric binner. ‘Target score’ was binned into increments of 5 for ranges: 60 to 80. Bins for ‘60 and below’ and ‘80 and above’ was also created

|![histogram group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_Hist_G1.png)|![histogram group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_Hist_G2.png)|
|<em>Histogram for group 1</em>|<em>Histogram for group 2</em>|

The histogram of both groups are negatively skewed, indicating that students generally did well for their first semester with the majority getting between 75 to 85 marks. The histograms also show us roughly how many students are performing poorly and resources can be provisioned accordingly.

The team hypothesized that the following factors have an impact on student performance and investigated accordingly.
-	Entrance scores have an impact on performance
-	Students' attendance has an impact on performance
-	Extraneous factors have an impact on student performance

<strong>Entrance scores have an impact on performance.</strong>

Using parallel plots, the team outlined the entrance scores to the ‘Target score’ of both groups of students. It is important to note that lower entrance score equates to better performance, while higher ‘Target score’ indicates better performance.

|![entrance group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_ent_para_G1.png)|![entrance group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_ent_para_G2.png)|
|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-1</em>|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-2</em>|

As seen from the parallel coordinates of both groups, in general students with good entrance scores will continue to do well, and vice versa, barring outliers. Therefore, the team concludes that entrance score is a factor that determines a students’ 1st semester score.

<strong>Attendance has an impact on performance.</strong>
Secondly, using parallel coordinates, the team charted the overall attendance to the ‘Target score’ of both groups of students.

|![attendance group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_att_para_G1.png)|![attendance group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_att_para_G2.png)|
|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-1</em>|<em>Parallel coordinate of Group-2</em>|

As shown by both graphs, students of both groups with a small range of attendance yielded a large range of grades. This implies that attendance does not have a strong correlation with performance. As such, we can conclude that attendance does not have a strong impact on performance.

<strong>Extraneous factors have an impact on performance.</strong>

Lastly, using a sunburst and conditional box plot, the team investigated if extraneous factors have any effects on student performance. The team defines extraneous factors as circumstances not directly related to academics. As such, the following attributes are considered extraneous factors: ‘Annual Household Income level’, ‘Part Time Job?’, ‘Internet?’, ‘Conduct in class’, ‘Disciplinary warning’, ‘Romance?’.

|![sunburst group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_sun_G1.png)|![sunburst group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_sun_G2.png)|
|<em>Sunburst chart of Group-1</em>|<em>Sunburst chart of Group-2</em>|

The sunburst chart is intended to give a quick overview of the demographics of Group 1 and Group 2.

For both groups, most of the students are from a high-income household, do not have a discipline record, have internet access, are not involved in a romantic relationship, do not have a part time job and have either ‘good’ or ‘very good conduct’.

Next, we will analyse each of the extraneous factors one by one to see if it affects student performance and see if it relates to the sunburst chart.

|![income group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_income_G1.png)|![income group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_income_G2.png)|
|<em>Boxplot of ‘Annual Household Income level’ to performance of Group-1</em>|<em>Boxplot of ‘Annual Household Income level’ to performance of Group-2</em>|

Students with an annual household income of ‘High’, ‘Middle’, ‘Low’ will be referred to as ‘InC-High’, ‘InC-Middle’ and ‘InC-Low’ respectively.

For Group-1, all 3 boxplots show relatively similar medians, Quarter 1, Quarter 3 and Interquartile range. InC-Middle has the widest range and the lowest lower fence.

For Group-2, the sample size of InC-Middle is too small to perform meaningful analysis. InC-High and InC-Middle shows similar performance due to similar medians, Quarter 1, Quarter 3, and upper and lower fences.  

Thus, we can conclude that annual <strong>household income is not a factor that affects the student’s performance.</strong>

|![PT group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_PT_G1.png)|![PT group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_PT_G2.png)|
|<em>Boxplot of ‘Part time job?’ to performance of Group-1</em>|<em>Boxplot of ‘Part time job?’ to performance of Group-2</em>|

According to the boxplot, the median for both groups are similar, ranging from 75.55 to 78.44. All 6 graphs show similar interquartile ranges between 4 to 7. Barring outliers, Group-1 shows an overall range of about 19 to 23 and Group-2 shows an overall range of about 5 to 7. Thus, we conclude that having part-time jobs does not have a strong impact on student performance.

|![INT group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_int_G1.png)|![INT group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_int_G2.png)|
|<em>Boxplot of ‘Internet?’ to performance of Group-1</em>|<em>Boxplot of ‘Internet?’ to performance of Group-2</em>|

Students with internet access and without internet access will be referred to as ‘INT-Yes’ and ‘INT-No’ respectively.  All 4 graphs show similar medians and interquartile ranges. Although INT-No of Group-1 has a slightly lower upper and lower fence than INT-Yes, while INT-No of Group-2 has a marginally higher lower fence than INT-Yes. As such, the team concludes that <strong>internet access is not a large factor for student performance.</strong>

The team also notes that INT-Yes of both groups contain outliers that perform worse than the lower fence of INT-No. This is the opposite of the team’s expectation that students without internet would perform worse than those with internet.

|![CON group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_CON_G1.png)|![CON group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_CON_G2.png)|
|<em>Boxplot of ‘Conduct in class’ to performance of Group-1</em>|<em>Boxplot of ‘Conduct in class’ to performance of Group-2</em>|

Students with conduct of ‘Very Good’, ‘Good’, ‘Moderate’ will be referred to as ‘CON-Very Good’, ‘CON-Good’ and ‘CON-Moderate’ respectively.

All graphs across both groups display similar trends. CON-Moderate has a lower median, Quarter 1, Quarter 3 and upper and lower fences than the other 2 graphs. It also has a higher interquartile range, despite having similar overall ranges compared to the other graphs. It is also noted that the upper fence of CON-Moderate is close to the median of CON-Good.

Therefore, due to the overall lower performance of CON-Moderate compared to CON-Good and CON-Very Good, it is concluded that <strong>conduct is a factor that affects performance and having a lower conduct grade has an impact on ‘Target score’.</strong>

|![Disc group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_CON_G1.png)|![Disc group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_CON_G2.png)|
|<em>Boxplot of ‘Disciplinary warning’ to performance of Group-1</em>|<em>Boxplot of ‘Disciplinary warning’ to performance of Group-2</em>|

Students with disciplinary records will be referred to as ‘DISC-Yes’ and students without disciplinary records will be referred to as ‘DISC-No’.

Group 2 does not have anyone with a discipline record. However, DISC-No of both groups show relatively similar median, Quarter 1, Quarter 3, and interquartile range. It is noted that there are more outliers for Group 1 and that can be attributed to Group 1 having more records than Group 2.

‘DISC-Yes’ performed worse than ‘DISC-No’. The Quarter 3 of ‘DISC-Yes’ is lower than the Quarter 1 of ‘DISC-No’ of both groups. The median of ‘DISC-No’ is lower than the lower fence of both ‘DISC-Yes’ while its Quarter 1 is close to the lowest outlier of both ‘DISC-Yes’. ‘DISC-Yes’ also showed less consistent performance than ‘DISC-No’ as it has a higher interquartile range than ‘DISC-No’ of both Groups.

Therefore, it is concluded that having a <strong>disciplinary warning is an indicator of student performance.</strong> Furthermore, from the sunburst chart, it is shown that most of the students with conduct grade of ‘moderate’ have a disciplinary record. Thus, we infer that there is a correlation between having a discipline record and conduct grades.

|![RO group 1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_CON_G1.png)|![RO group 2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_CON_G2.png)|
|<em>Boxplot of ‘Disciplinary warning’ to performance of Group-1</em>|<em>Boxplot of ‘Disciplinary warning’ to performance of Group-2</em>|

The graphs of both groups show similar medians, Quarter 1, Quarter 3, interquartile range as well as upper and lower fences. Therefore, the graphs of both groups show that<strong> romance does not have a significant impact on performance</strong> as students show consistent performance across all graphs, disregarding outliers.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

|![Summary G1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_SUM_G1.png)|
|<em>Summarised parallel coordinate plots of Group-1</em>|
|![Summary G2](/assets/images/SP-knime/M1_SUM_G2.png)|
|<em>Summarised parallel coordinate plots of Group-2</em>|

The team has summarised all factors we have discovered into the above 2 parallel plots. Both groups also have relatively similar data based on all the factors we investigated.

As seen from both graphs, students with good entrance scores will continue to do well and vice versa. Thus, our first factor will be ‘Entrance test score’ to determine who requires more support. Our other factors are ‘Conduct in class’ and ‘Disciplinary Warning’. Among those factors, disciplinary warning affects the performance the most. Students with disciplinary warnings need more support from the school as they did not perform well enough compared to the students who do not have disciplinary warnings. We can greatly improve the performance status by improving the discipline of students. Similarly, those whose conduct grade is ‘moderate’ may require more support from the school and improve their attitude as they are not performing as well as those with ‘good’ and ‘very good’ conduct.

In conclusion, disciplinary and conduct of students is important in improving and maintaining the performance. Entrance score, while important, is not something that the institution can change. However, the constitution can monitor students with weaker entrance scores and aid them accordingly.

<strong>4A. Modelling with clustering</strong>

As our target variable is the target score and from the boxplot below, it is deduced that student conduct grade has an impact on target score. our optimal number of groupings will be 3 groups. This will fit the ‘very good’, ‘good’ and ‘moderate’ of the conduct grade and also help us to deduce the accuracy of the clustering and also further aid our conduct grade analysis. Afterwards, we can see how accurate our clustering is in helping us predict target score.

|![Conduct against target overall](/assets/images/SP-knime/M2_con_tar.png)|
|<em>Boxplot of conduct grade against target scores overall</em>|

<strong>Model(students taking science)</strong>

|![Conduct against target G1](/assets/images/SP-knime/M2_con_tar_G1.png)|
|<em>Statistics of Conduct against target score</em>|
|![Conduct against target G1 para](/assets/images/SP-knime/M2_con_tar_para_G1.png)|
|<em>Parallel plot of Conduct against target score</em>|

The clustering model tells us that in general, students with high ‘Target scores’ generally performed well for all of their individual subjects, ‘Overall 1st sem. score’ and ‘Entrance test’ and vice versa.

Students in cluster 0 generally have the highest ‘Target score’ of 80.99, cluster 2 have the lowest ‘Target score’ with 74.589 and cluster 1 is in the middle with 66.33. The parallel coordinate plot tells us that in general, students in cluster 0 have either ‘very-good’ or ‘good’ conduct. Cluster 1 generally has ‘good’ or ‘moderate’ conduct and cluster 2 generally has ‘moderate’ conduct. This is consistent with our findings in milestone 1 where we discovered that students with poorer conduct have poorer ‘Target scores’.

<strong>Model(students not taking science)</strong>

|![Conduct against target G2 stats](/assets/images/SP-knime/M2_con_tar_G2.png)|
|<em>Statistics of Conduct against target score</em>|
|![Conduct against target G2 para](/assets/images/SP-knime/M2_con_tar_para_G2.png)|
|<em>Parallel plot of Conduct against target score</em>|

Similar to ‘students taking science’, ‘students not taking science’ with high ‘Target scores’ generally performed well for all of their individual subjects, ‘Overall 1st sem. score’ and ‘Entrance test’ and vice versa. 

Students in cluster 1 generally have the highest ‘Target score’ of 78.914, cluster 2 have the lowest ‘Target score’ with 73.509 and cluster 1 is in the middle with 64.308. Unlike ‘students taking science’, the parallel coordinate plot tells us that the conduct grades ‘students not taking science’ are less clearly separated. While students with ‘good’ conduct grades are generally from cluster 1 and cluster 0, conduct grades of ‘good’ and ‘moderate’ have students from all 3 clusters. However, students from cluster 2 can still be seen as having worse conduct grades than the other 2 clusters.

<strong>In conclusion, for students taking science, students with moderate conduct grades tend to have poorer ‘Target scores’ and vice versa. For students not taking science, the conduct grades of students are less clear cut, but the trend of students with poor conduct grades tend to have poorer ‘Target scores’ still holds true. ‘Target scores’ is the aggregate of all individual subjects, hence students with worse ‘Target scores’ generally have worse individual subject scores. Hence, we can deduce that those students sorted to cluster_2 will be the students in need.</strong>

<strong>4B. Modelling with Decision tree</strong>

For the purposes of this analysis, the team decided that students who scored less than 70% for their target scores will be considered at risk. The team binned ‘Target score’ using the following settings. The reason behind this action is to group the students considered ‘At-risk’ together to better discover trends present. Below are the settings that the team used to build our model. All variables were used in the modelling of the decision tree.
