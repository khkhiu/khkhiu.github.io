<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
'Introduction to Engineering' aims equips students with engineering fundamentals set in the context of CDIO (conceive, design, implement and operate) in real-world systems with basic electronic projects. It aims to nurture students toward self-directed learners by giving them a challenging environment to plan, manage, review and extend their learning outcomes using growth mind-set and meta-cognitive learning systems in achieving their electronic projects. Besides, students will be exposed to a range of generic process skills such as troubleshooting skills, creative and critical thinking, teamwork and communication.

'Engineering & Engineering Design Solutions' is a continuation of 'Introduction to Engineering'. This module aims to nurture students toward self-directed learners by giving them a more challenging environment to plan, manage, review and extend their learning outcomes using growth mind and meta-cognitive learning systems in achieving their electronic projects.
