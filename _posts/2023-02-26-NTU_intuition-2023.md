<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
iNTUition is one of South East Asiaâ€™s largest 24-hour hackathon, organised by the IEEE NTU student branch. Participants can choose to tackle problems statements offered by event sponsors, or opt for the 'Open track', which allows them to build anything they want.

<strong>Project built</strong>

***
The project I built is intended for the 'Open Track'. I created a simple browser-playable Tetris game using Javascript and HTML by following tutorials on YouTube. The intend behind the project was to allow me to practice basic programming by building a simple project. Furthermore, I wanted to try something different for this hackathon, as all of my previous hackathon projects utilized cloud computing.

Players use the arrow keys to play the game.
