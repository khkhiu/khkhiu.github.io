<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
 iNTUition is one of South East Asiaâ€™s largest 24-hour hackathon, organised by the IEEE NTU student branch. Students can choose to tackle tracks, which contain problems statements offered by event sponsors, or opt for the 'Open track', which allows them to build anything they want.
