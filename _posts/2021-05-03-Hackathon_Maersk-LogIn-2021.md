<strong>Introduction</strong>

***

Sealand Asia Log-In Challenge is a forum where students can apply their knowledge and come up with fresh and innovative ideas that can be applied in shipping and logistics so that Sealand Maersk can enhance customers’ experience in shipping and logistics. 

***

<strong>Opportunity Statement and Guide Questions(verbatim)</strong>

***

From registering online to be our customer to finding a price, from making a booking to submitting shipping instruction, from retrieving invoice online to making payment online, from purchasing additional supply chain services to tracking shipment online, a customer’s shipment end-to-end journey requires backend involvement and coordination of many peoples, tasks, processes, documentations and systems.

Many of these tasks, processes and documentations are still heavily dependent on manual work and physical paperwork. In Sealand Maersk, we continuously strive for digitalization and automation in order to increase productivity, reduce manual work gap and improve digital customer experience by adopting digital innovations such AI chatbot, e-payment, electronic bill of lading etc.

With this scenario and what you may know of container shipping and logistics, we would like to invite you to propose ideas on digital innovations which Sealand Asia should consider to achieve the aims mentioned. You may submit a business case to us that talks about the current scenario, what is the idea, what benefits does the idea bring and what technology can be used to develop the idea.

<strong>Benefits of blockchain</strong>

***
Blockchain technology presents a novel approach to monitor supply chain events, leveraging immutable ledgers that offer cryptographic proof that each transaction remains unaltered since being recorded. This feature is especially advantageous for supply chain auditing, as it ensures that the manufacturing, transportation, storage, and usage history of a given product or part remains unaltered since the time of a failure event.

Furthermore, in addition to providing an immutable record-keeping system, many blockchain protocols enable the deployment of decentralized, programmable logic written as code, commonly known as "smart contracts." These contracts allow for the execution of multi-party business logic on the blockchain, providing network members such as retailers and suppliers with authorization to process specific transactions. By implementing a supply chain on a blockchain, network members can securely process authorized transactions, ensuring transparency and accountability across the entire supply chain.

Customers using Amazon Managed Blockchain can participate in either private Hyperledger Fabric networks or the Public Ethereum network. Managed Blockchain provides relief from the burdensome task of creating, configuring, and maintaining the infrastructure of a Hyperledger Fabric network, enabling you to concentrate on essential activities that drive value such as constructing consortia or developing components specific to use cases. By using this service, you can establish and supervise a scalable Hyperledger Fabric network to which multiple organizations can connect from their AWS account.
