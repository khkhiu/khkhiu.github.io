**Background information** I am using the book: <a href="https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e">Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition</a> to teach myself the basics of python. This is a follow up post: <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/learning%20process/personal-python-basics/"> Python Basics. </a>
{: .notice--info}


Python Crash Course is split into 2 parts. The first part covers the basics of python , which can be found <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/learning%20process/personal-python-basics/"> here </a>. The second part consist of 3 projects.

1. Space shooter with pygame
2. Data Visualisation with Matplotlib and Plotly
3. Web Applications with Django

This post covers part 2 "Data Visualisation with Matplotlib and Plotly" For part 1: Space shooter with pygame, click <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/learning%20process/personal-python-basics_2-pygame/"> here </a>

<strong>Plotting a simple line graph</strong>

***

A simple graph can be generated using a list along with the functions: "fig", "ax" and "subplot". Where "fig" is the entire figure or collection of plots that are generated, "ax" is a single plot in the figure and is the variable weâ€™ll use most of the time, and "subplot" allows for generation one or more plots in the same figure. Lastly, the "plot()" method was used to plot the graph.

<strong>Changing the Label Type and Line Thickness</strong>

Next, the "linewidth" parameter, "set_" methods and "tick_params()" methods are used to customise the appearance of the graph. Where "tick_params()" is used to style tick marks.

<strong>Adjusting the plot</strong>

Code is now added to correct the plot of the graph so that the Y-axis value is the square value of th X-axis value.

<strong>Using Built-in Styles</strong>

Built in styles are now added to improve readability of the graph.

<strong>Scatter plot</strong>

***
Using ".scatter" a scatter plot can be created.

Similar to the line graph, scatter plots can be customised to improve readability. More points were also added at this point
