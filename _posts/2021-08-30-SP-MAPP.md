<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
'Micro-controller Applications' introduces the use of micro-controllers in a range of system applications. Students are taught how a micro-controller works, how to program it, and the use of micro-controller. In addition, students will learn basic analogue and digital support circuitry, sensors and actuators/displays required for a micro-controller based application. This module allows students to develop a project conceived around a micro-controller system with sensors and output devices.
