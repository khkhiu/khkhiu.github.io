<strong>Introductions</strong>

***

Youth Expedition Project (YEP) is a Service-Learning programme by Youth Corps Singapore aimed at nurturing confident and resilient youths with the desire to make a difference both at home and overseas.

This usually takes the form of an overseas service learning opportunity where participants physically go over to the partner country to perform various task. However, due to COVID19, the YEP I participated effectively became a cultural exchange programme rather than a service learning programme.
