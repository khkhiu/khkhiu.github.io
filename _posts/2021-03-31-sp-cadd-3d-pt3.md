For information on Assignment 1: <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/singapore%20polytechnic/sp-cadd-3d-pt1/">Computer Aided Drafting - 3D, part 1</a>

In an interesting turn of events, assignment 2 requires us to design a smartphone holder using Fusion 360. Unlike assignment 1, where the designs were intended to be 3d printed, assignment 2 was intended to be laser cut instead. However due to COVID19, we only had to design and did not get to physically make the items.
