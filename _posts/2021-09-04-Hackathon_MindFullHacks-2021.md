<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
MindfulHacks was founded as Singapore's first Mental Health-themed Student Hackathon. It is a 24-hour overnight hackathon where attendees work to build a software project that addresses mental health issues. Our mission is to encourage students to come together and innovate solutions to mental health issues and combat the stigma of mental illness. We welcome students from Universities, Polytechnics, ITEs, and Junior Colleges.

<strong>Areas of improvement</strong>

***
The most important area of improvement is the involvement of actual psychiatrist and domain experts. This is important as no one  in the team is an expert on mental health, as such we need input from domain experts to make our chatbot effective in addressing mental health concerns.

Another are of improvement is the addition of machine learning to improve the performance of the chatbot. Machine learning can be used to learn the most effective response to any given scenario, thus making it more effective in addressing user needs.

lastly, the team still needed to find an effective way to package and deliver the chatbot into hands of users.
