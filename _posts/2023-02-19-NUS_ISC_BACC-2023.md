<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
Beginning in 2012, the Industrial and Systems Engineering Club at the National University of Singapore has been hosting the NUS-ISE Business Analytics Case Competition annually. This competition brings together participants who are tasked with solving real-world business problems presented by industry partners. Upon receiving the case question, participants are required to quickly comprehend the issue, evaluate different scenarios and potential obstacles, and present a recommendation supported by quantitative analysis to a panel of judges within a limited time frame.

The industry partner for the NUS-ISE Business Analytics Case Competition 2023 is Micron Technology.

<strong>Problem Statement</strong>

***

Memory is a crucial component in the technology industry, powering everything from 5G smartphones to the AI-enabled cloud. To meet the increasing demand for memory in the data economy of the future, Micron has announced plans to invest more than $150 billion in manufacturing and R&D over the next decade.

As a major supplier of DRAM and NAND memory chips, Micron Semiconductor has made significant investments in expanding its production capacity. This includes acquiring new plants, such as the Mega-fab being built in Central New York with an investment of up to $100 billion. Micron Semiconductor has also expanded its existing plants, including two expansions in Singapore and a recent announcement to expand in Boise, Idaho.

In this Business Analytics Case Competition, we will focus on strategically planning locations to further increase our production capabilities.
