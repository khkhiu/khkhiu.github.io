<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
The NUS-ISE Business Analytics Case Competition is an annual competition organised by the Industrial and Systems Engineering Club at the National University of Singapore since 2012.

Participants come together to solve real-world business problems set by our industry partners. After receiving the case question, they have to race against time to understand the problem, consider various scenarios and pain-points, and finally make a recommendation backed by sound quantitative analysis to our panel of judges.

The partner for the NUS-ISE Business Analytics Case Competition 2023 is Micron Technology.
