<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
The SMU LIT Hacakathon 2021 is organised by the SMU Legal Innovation & Technology (LIT ) club. Held from 13 to 15 August 2021 over zoom and discord, the event brings together students from all Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning to tackle legal-tech problems faced in law, business and community. 

This Hackathon seeks to allow participants to appreciate the synergy between technology and the legal sphere. During this event, law firms provide a set of Problem Statements, which covers diverse topics such as automating research, legal analytics and access to justice. Participant teams will choose a single Problem Statement provided and build a prototype solution.
