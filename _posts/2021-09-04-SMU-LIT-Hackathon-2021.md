<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
The SMU LIT Hacakathon 2021 is organised by the SMU Legal Innovation & Technology (LIT ) club. Held from 13 to 15 August 2021 over zoom and discord, the event brings together students from all Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning to tackle legal-tech problems faced in law, business and community. 

In groups of three to five with at least one law student, the participants were tasked to develop technological solutions to real-world problem statements provided by industry partners. These included topics such as automating research, legal analytics and access to justice under the theme of “The Next Decade in Legal Tech in Singapore”.

<strong>Problem statements</strong>

The problem statements were split in to the following themes:

| Theme    | Preamble |Problem statements|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|Rise of Asia|With a burgeoning middle class and rising demand for goods and services in and from Asia, Asia is expected to continue showing strong economic growth. This also signals a parallel demand for legal market services in the region.|Expanding Regionally: In this globalized and digital age, businesses are no longer
confined to or defined by their home jurisdiction, and their lawyers need to keep
pace as well.
How best can local lawyers who seek to expand their legal practice and regional
expertise gather the relevant expertise and establish regional networks? (By
Linklaters)|

|Operational Pressures amidst COVID-19|COVID-19 has been a major driving force towards the digitalisation of the legal industry. At the same time, this has led to growing concerns about technological solutions and a longing to further leverage it in the pursuit of justice.||
