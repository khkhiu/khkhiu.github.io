<strong>Introduction</strong>

***
The SMU LIT Hacakathon 2021 is organised by the SMU Legal Innovation & Technology (LIT ) club. Held from 13 to 15 August 2021 over zoom and discord, the event brings together students from all Singapore Institutes of Higher Learning to tackle legal-tech problems faced in law, business and community. 

In groups of three to five with at least one law student, the participants were tasked to develop technological solutions to real-world problem statements provided by industry partners. These included topics such as automating research, legal analytics and access to justice under the theme of “The Next Decade in Legal Tech in Singapore”.

<strong>Problem statements</strong>

***
The team that I was in,CodeBrigade, investigated the following themes:

<strong>Theme 1: Rise of Asia</strong>

Preamble: With a burgeoning middle class and rising demand for goods and services in and from Asia, Asia is expected to continue showing strong economic growth.1 This also signals a parallel demand for legal market services in the region.

| Title     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|<em>Inter-jurisdictional Streamlining</em>|<strong>Expanding Regionally:</strong> In this globalized and digital age, businesses are no longer confined to or defined by their home jurisdiction, and their lawyers need to keep pace as well.<br><br>How best can local lawyers who seek to expand their legal practice and regional expertise gather the relevant expertise and establish regional networks? <br>(By Linklaters)|


<strong>Theme 2: Operational Pressures amidst COVID-19</strong>

Preamble: COVID-19 has been a major driving force towards the digitalisation of the legal industry. At the same time, this has led to growing concerns about technological solutions
and a longing to further leverage it in the pursuit of justice.


| Title     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|<em>Remote Working/ Telecommuting:</em>|<strong>Psychological Risks: </strong>Telecommuting has blurred the line between work and home, and this is exacerbated by an increasingly prevalent "always-on" culture coupled with the accessibility availed by modern technology.<br><br>While circuit breaker and social distancing regulations have proven effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19, the measures put in place could also contribute to psychological and interpersonal risks that extend beyond the obvious health and economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if an individual has the good fortune of remaining healthy and financially stable during this period, he/she could still be vulnerable to stress, anxiety and interpersonal tension and conflict.<br><br>With hybrid / remote working fast becoming the norm, how might we mitigate these psychological risks?<br><br>(By Dentons Rodyk)|
|<em>Cybersecurity </em>|<strong>Verification: </strong>The challenges brought about during the COVID-19 pandemic forced communications to go almost fully online. How can we create a solution to verify the authenticity of identity, signatures, timestamps and locations?<br><br>(By Dentons Rodyk)|

<strong>Solution</strong>

***
After some discussion, the team opted to build an interactive chatbot using Amazon Web Service(AWS) Sumerian. We intended to differentiate our chatbot by giving it a 3D model and by having users speak to it and have it respond in kind. The idea was to simulate speaking to a psychiatrist, thus giving it a more personal touch and making it more effective. The solution is also available on demand, making it more convenient than normal psychiatrist.
