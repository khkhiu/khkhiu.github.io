For reasons that have been lost to time, I decided to start learning python. I learnt the basics of python using the book: Python Crash Course, 2nd edition by Eric Matthes, published by No Starch Press.

Unlike other post, this post will be a summary of various checkpoints instead of a walk-through(mostly because it is 223 pages across 11 chapter and later chapters heavily utilize concepts in earlier chapters).
