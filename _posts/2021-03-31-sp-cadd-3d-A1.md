Introductions

***

As part of our Computer Aided Drafting module, we were tasked with the following:
1. Design a key chain

2. Design a desk organiser that fulfilled the following criteria: 
  - The key chain had to be integrated into the design 
  - Consist of at least 3 functions, e.g. pencil holder, stabler holder etc.
  - Must not exceed 120mm x 120mm x 120mm

***

Key Chain

***

The design of the key chain is standardised throughout the course and as such was provided for us.  We first had to draw an 80mm by 25mm base and extrude it by 5mm

Second, to create the key ring, we drew 2 15mm by 7.5mm rectangles at the edge of the rectangle. A 6mm hole was also drawn between the 2 new rectangles. A construction line was use determine the exact location of were the circle should be placed. The extrude function was then used to cut out the rectangle and circle.

To further refine the design, we halved the height of the key ring, filleted and chamfer the edges accordingly.

Lastly, we wrote our names on the keychain and extruded it to 'stamp' it onto the keychain.

And with that, we completed the keychain aspect of our assignment

Desk Organiser

***

As per the stipulated requirements, my desk organiser has the following functions:
- Key chain integrated to the front of the design
- Phone holder at the front
- 4 silos for pens and similar objects 
- 2 deep rectangular compartments for miscellaneous items
- 1 shallow rectangular compartment for erasers

Design thoughts and process: Phone compartment

***

The key chain was first imported into a new file to allow easier visualisation for integration

|<em>Imported key chain</em>|


The idea of the phone holder was an attempt by me to do something that I believe would be unique.

The structure of the phone holder was created using the create box command with the dimensions of 100mm by 30mm by 120mm

|<em>Front view</em>|

The structure was then extruded to make a platform to hold the phone. A hole was subsequently created with the hole command to allow for a charging cable to inserted into the phone holder. The edges were also filleted

Design thoughts and process: Key chain integration

***
An 'L' shaped structure was created using sketch and extrude commands to allow for accommodation of the key chain. The idea behind the 'L' shape was to give a compartment for keys to be placed. This structure was then hollowed and trimmed.

The key chain was then moved into the compartment. The extrude commands was then used to 'encase' the key chain. The cut command was used to further refine the integration of the key chain with the desk organiser.Lastly, a segment of the structure was the extruded to make a compartment for the keys

Design thoughts and process: Stationary compartment

***
A new body at the back of the was created using the modify:press pull and modify:shell commands. The modify: press pull command was used again to raise the base of the middle structure of the 3 small rectangles.

The create:cylinder command along with the modify:shell command was used to create the cylinders meant to accommodate pens.

Lastly, dimension measurements were added as indicated in the submission requirements before being exported and submitted.
