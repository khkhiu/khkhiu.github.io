Introductions

***

**Engineering Academy(EA)** Engineering Academy is a programme taken along with our diplomas that aims to further educate us on aspects of engineering through practical experiences.

Along with Git and GitHub, we were also required to create a personal website that will act as a repository for both our school projects and personal projects. To achieve this, we were to use Github pages to host our site. Github pages allows users to host a webpage directly from their Github repositories, which along with the advantages mentioned <a href="https://khkhiu.github.io/engineering%20academy/engcad-github/"> here </a>, also allows us to use jekyll(This will be important later).

Learning

***

Despite having learnt about both HTML and CSS in my previous course, I have largely forgotten most of it(In my defence, I learnt it in 2014). As such I spend quite some time watching youtube videos and following along with the on screen examples.

I mainly watched the following 2 videos. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg"> HTML Full Course - Build a Website Tutorial </a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ"> FreeCodeCamp.org </a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">HTML Crash Course For Absolute Beginners </a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA"> Traversy Media </a>.
