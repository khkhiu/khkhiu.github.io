<strong>Introduction</strong>

***

Sealand Asia Log-In Challenge is a forum where students can apply their knowledge and come up with fresh and innovative ideas that can be applied in shipping and logistics so that Sealand Maersk can enhance customers’ experience in shipping and logistics. 

***

<strong>Opportunity Statement and Guide Questions(verbatim)</strong>

***

From registering online to be our customer to finding a price, from making a booking to submitting shipping instruction, from retrieving invoice online to making payment online, from purchasing additional supply chain services to tracking shipment online, a customer’s shipment end-to-end journey requires backend involvement and coordination of many peoples, tasks, processes, documentations and systems.

Many of these tasks, processes and documentations are still heavily dependent on manual work and physical paperwork. In Sealand Maersk, we continuously strive for digitalization and automation in order to increase productivity, reduce manual work gap and improve digital customer experience by adopting digital innovations such AI chatbot, e-payment, electronic bill of lading etc.

With this scenario and what you may know of container shipping and logistics, we would like to invite you to propose ideas on digital innovations which Sealand Asia should consider to achieve the aims mentioned. You may submit a business case to us that talks about the current scenario, what is the idea, what benefits does the idea bring and what technology can be used to develop the idea.

<strong>Solution</strong>

***

Using Amazon Web Services(AWS) blockchain, a track and trace system can be created that would streamline the logistics process.

A key issue facing international shipping is the associated paperwork required at various ports. As such I propose a blockchain based systems where all parties involved can upload needed documents and all other parties can view said paperwork. 

A blockchain is used to ensure data integrity and allow all parties involved can verify said integrity. The system can further be expanded to provide update on the location and status of goods being shipped. 

<strong>Unfortunately, I did not get footage of the system I built, but what I did is encapsulated in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-AjS-WuF2Q">
