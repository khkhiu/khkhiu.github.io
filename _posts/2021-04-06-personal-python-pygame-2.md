<strong>Review of project</strong>

***

After completing the player's space ship, we need to do the following:

1. Add a alien to the top of the screen with appropriate spacing

2. Using spacing of the first alien and overall screen size, write a loop to populate the top of the screen

3. Make the fleet move towards the player until one of the following happens. The entire alien fleet is shot down, in which case, spawn a new fleet. The alien fleet hits, the ground or player, then destroy the player ship, spawn a new player ship and fleet.

4. Limit number of ships player can use, end the game when supply is exhausted.

5. Refactor code as needed.

With this in mind, lets carry on.

<strong>Making an alien</strong>

***
To expedite this project(as I have more in the queue), I will not be making a custom alien, but rather be using the one provided by No Starch Press. A file: alien.py will also be created to control the alien's behaviour.

To ensure that the code was working properly, I imported the alien.py file to main game file(space_invaders.py).

A method called _create_fleet() was made to hold the (eventual) fleet of aliens. In this method, one instance of Alien was made, then added to the group that will hold the fleet. The alien is the placed in the upper left of the screen.

To make the alien appear, I need to call the groupâ€™s draw() method to _update_screen(): When we call draw() on groups, Pygame draw elements of the group at positions defined by rect attributes. The draw() method
requires a surface to draw the elements from the group.

<strong>Building the fleet</strong>

***

To build a fleet, I need to determine how many alien can fit across the screen. This is achieved by determining the horizontal spacing between aliens and forming a row. The vertical spacing is then determined to create the entire fleet

<strong>Aliens in a row</strong>

Screen width is stored in settings.screen_width. To ensure empty margins on both sides of the screen, I made the space available for aliens the screen width minus 2 alien widths. Spacing is also required between aliens, hence I made the spacing 1 alien width. Thus the space between an alien is 2 alien widths.
