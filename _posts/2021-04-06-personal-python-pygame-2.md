<strong>Review of project</strong>

***

After completing the player's space ship, we need to do the following:

1. Add a alien to the top of the screen with appropriate spacing

2. Using spacing of the first alien and overall screen size, write a loop to populate the top of the screen

3. Make the fleet move towards the player until one of the following happens. The entire alien fleet is shot down, in which case, spawn a new fleet. The alien fleet hits, the ground or player, then destroy the player ship, spawn a new player ship and fleet.

4. Limit number of ships player can use, end the game when supply is exhausted.

5. Refactor code as needed.

With this in mind, lets carry on.
