<strong>Problem statement(recreated to the best of my abilities)</strong>

***
<strong>Retirement Solutions for a More Fulfilling Life</strong> The life expectance in Singapore is increasing due to factors such as improved medical care. Therefore, solutions need to be devised to allow for the elderly to live a more fulfilling life in their twilight years. 

***

<strong>Significance of problem</strong>

***
Retiring from work means leaving the active population and no longer contributing to society, hence cutting off his/her active income. Few retirees manage to acquire a way to gain a passive income, or save enough money thanks to personal achievements, the CPF funds, or retirement plannings available to live comfortably. However, most will still rely on their younger family members and relatives to support their livelihoods[1]. This will make retirees feel like burdens to society, and impact their mental health. Furthermore, with the declining birth rates in Singapore[2], some retirees might not have any children to support them and will struggle financially after retirement.
Another problem is that retirees will often spend their time idly because they do not have any pastimes, or do not have the skills to enjoy a pastime[3]. Hence they will most likely feel bored or bad to not contribute anything, as well as lead to a decline in cognitive abilities.

Therefore our team’s solution will provide a fulfilling life to retirees by ensuring that they are financially well through good retirement planning and others, as well as have a meaningful activity they can spend their time on and possibly profit from it.

<strong>Solutions Introduction </strong>

***
Our proposed solution will be a platform for current and future retirees which will suggest activities, hobbies, or events according to their profile, financial status, and health condition, as well as recommend appropriate retirement plans using AI technology based on those activities. This will allow them to stay physical and remain social while doing relevant activities.

Example of available activities/events (non-exhaustive):
1. Partner with organisations to allow retirees to contribute part-time:
    - Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and their associated farms[4][5] allows for physically able retirees to help with farm output
    - National Environment Agency (NEA) allows for retirees to volunteer in their recycling efforts
2. Community Centre (CC) workshops/lessons to teach elderlies/retirees new skills:
    - These skills can be applied in future DBS events (e.g. Carnivals), which will allow elderlies/retirees to spend their time more meaningful and possibly earn some money from these events
    - This will also allow elderlies/retirees to make new friends which they can hang out with after the workshops in order to have someone to talk to every day and not feel bored at home
    - Elderlies/retirees can also participate in these events with their love ones in order to spend meaningful time and to build stronger bonds with one another 
3. Investment workshops/talks regarding how best to plan for your retirement, as well as opportunities such as:
    - Housing investments
    - Property investments
    - Shares/Stock market
    - Gold

The platform will be in the form of a web application as the content is information heavy and a mobile application might not be as effective in conveying information, whether textual or visual. Activities will most likely require administrative work requested by partners as well, which might not be suitable in a mobile format.

<strong>Impact of Solution  </strong>

***
The solution has several benefits for our target audience. 
Firstly, physical activity. This is accomplished as the bulk of hobbies and other recreational activities can have elements of physical action. This benefits the audience by allowing them to maintain bone and muscle health, thereby reducing the risks of falling and bone fractures. The physical activity could also help with other issues such as relieving blood pressure.[6][7]
Secondly, this allows the audience to maintain a connection to society. This not only allows the audience to be able to expand their social circles and maintain an emotional support network, but also has numerous other health benefits. Loneliness has been linked to a decline in cognitive abilities[8], as well as a noticeable uptick in blood pressure and cardiac issues.[9][10] Therefore, by providing the elderly with a social outlet, we are able to ensure better physical health as well as maintaining a friend group.

Next, improved financial education and retirement planning would not only be a boon for the elderly but their families at large as well. Improved financial literacy would allow the elderly to better plan and manage their finances before and during their twilight years. This would reduce the need for them to 
rely on their family members, thereby freeing resources for the family for use in other endeavour. Furthermore, investments over the course of several years can yield a stream of passive income for them, hence reducing the need to rely solely on their savings and CPF.

|SWOT| Explanation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Strength(S)|Being backed by the DBS bank will allow our solution to have a greater reach than community-runned efforts. This is due to DBS already having a large customer base for us to tap into.<br><br>The name ‘DBS bank’ also carries prestige which may allow us to be partnered up with numerous agencies and organisations like Health Promotion Board(HPB) and Central Provident Fund(CPF) more easily.|
|Weakness(W)|Heavy use of technology in the solution could result in the elderly having difficulty using it to its fullest potential, as the elderlies may not be familiar on how to use the website application.<br><br>Inherent instability in the stocks and commodities market could prove difficult for the elderly to understand.<br><br>Potentially long travel times, depending on the location of the activity held.|
|Opportunity(O)|Aging population in Singapore will allow our solution to reach an increasingly wider target audience, thereby allowing for broad appeal and expansion.<br><br>An expanded network of organisations due to connections from DBS could result in greater collaboration between agencies. Allowing for more diverse projects and events.|
|Threats(T)|External events like COVID19 will limit the usability of the solution. COVID19 resulted in stringent limits being placed on the accessibility of public events. This will negatively impact the solution as it is reliant on the abilities of groups to meet in public.<br><br>Other events, like a recession, will cause organisations to reduce funding and efforts to collaborate and run events due to limitation of funds. This results in fewer events for the elderly to participate in.|

|PEST| Explanation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Political(P)|In Singapore, the government is open to ideas that can help the local community, especially if it is a national concern like retirement for an aging population. Therefore, the political environment will not pose a threat to the implementation of our solution, or may even make it easier to implement.|
|Economical(E)|The COVID-19 situation has greatly reduced the economy’s health, hence physical activities that could have become a business idea in normal times and a source of income for the retirees are now harder to implement and find. This greatly limits the number of physical business activities, like fairs or carnivals manned by retirees. However, there could still be online opportunities for them.|
|Social(S)|Due to COVID-19, social activities will be restricted in the number of people involved, and might not be as effective. People will be heavily discouraged in participating, retired people in particular because they are most likely the elderly, and COVID-19 can be fatal for them. Social distancing measures will have to be implemented if the involved people will still go through with the event, which will require more manpower, equipment, and time.|
|Technological(T)|Nowadays, the use of a computer is considered a basic skill, so most future retirees will be able to navigate the website. However, current retirees might have trouble with computer skills, but thankfully younger family members or acquaintances can help in that regard, especially now, during the COVID-19 period where people are forced to use the Internet.<br><br>Furthermore, with the advent of AI technology being more accessible and powerful, along with the data-hungry mindset, our solution will become better at suggesting activities over time.|

The unique selling point of the solution would be the backing of DBS bank. The organisation of activities and financial literacy workshops are typically held by grassroots organisations, like Community Centres. As such events often have very limited reach, typically limited to the neighbourhood. Furthermore, due to limited resources, like funding and volunteers, events could be sporadic and far between each other.
The involvement of DBS bank allows for several advantages over community lead efforts. Firstly, being the largest bank in Singapore, DBS is able to reach a significantly wider audience. The solution could be sold as part of an ‘Active Aging’ package to their current install base, hence being able to reach everyone who banks with them, and potentially those who do not. Secondly, the involvement from DBS can entice other organisations to collaborate. The name of ‘DBS’ carries sway in the context of Singapore. Hence, this would be attractive to other organisations as backing of DBS would guarantee a level of organisation and competency above that of a typical community centre. This would cause other organisations to be willing to organise more events, thereby giving the elderly a wider variety of events to participate in.
