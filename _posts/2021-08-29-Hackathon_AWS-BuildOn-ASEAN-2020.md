<strong>Introduction</strong>

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Build On, ASEAN is a competitive hackathon that challenges the community to create technological initiatives and solutions to address challenges faced by participating sponsors.

<strong>Problem statement(recreated to the best of my abilities)</strong>

***
<strong>Retirement Solutions for a More Fulfilling Life</strong> The life expectance in Singapore is increasing due to factors such as improved medical care. Therefore, solutions need to be devised to allow for the elderly to live a more fulfilling life in their twilight years. 

***

<strong>Significance of problem</strong>

***
Retiring from work means leaving the active population and no longer contributing to society, hence cutting off his/her active income. Few retirees manage to acquire a way to gain a passive income, or save enough money thanks to personal achievements, the CPF funds, or retirement plannings available to live comfortably. However, most will still rely on their younger family members and relatives to support their livelihoods[1]. This will make retirees feel like burdens to society, and impact their mental health. Furthermore, with the declining birth rates in Singapore[2], some retirees might not have any children to support them and will struggle financially after retirement.
Another problem is that retirees will often spend their time idly because they do not have any pastimes, or do not have the skills to enjoy a pastime[3]. Hence they will most likely feel bored or bad to not contribute anything, as well as lead to a decline in cognitive abilities.

Therefore our teamâ€™s solution will provide a fulfilling life to retirees by ensuring that they are financially well through good retirement planning and others, as well as have a meaningful activity they can spend their time on and possibly profit from it.

<strong>Solutions Introduction </strong>

***
Our proposed solution will be a platform for current and future retirees which will suggest activities, hobbies, or events according to their profile, financial status, and health condition, as well as recommend appropriate retirement plans using AI technology based on those activities. This will allow them to stay physical and remain social while doing relevant activities.

Example of available activities/events (non-exhaustive):
1. Partner with organisations to allow retirees to contribute part-time:
    -Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and their associated farms[4][5] allows for physically able retirees to help with farm output
    -National Environment Agency (NEA) allows for retirees to volunteer in their recycling efforts
2. Community Centre (CC) workshops/lessons to teach elderlies/retirees new skills:
    -These skills can be applied in future DBS events (e.g. Carnivals), which will allow elderlies/retirees to spend their time more meaningful and possibly earn some money from these events
    -This will also allow elderlies/retirees to make new friends which they can hang out with after the workshops in order to have someone to talk to every day and not feel bored at home
    -Elderlies/retirees can also participate in these events with their love ones in order to spend meaningful time and to build stronger bonds with one another 
3. Investment workshops/talks regarding how best to plan for your retirement, as well as opportunities such as:
    -Housing investments
    -Property investments
    -Shares/Stock market
    -Gold, etc.

The platform will be in the form of a web application as the content is information heavy and a mobile application might not be as effective in conveying information, whether textual or visual. Activities will most likely require administrative work requested by partners as well, which might not be suitable in a mobile format.
