Introductions

***

**Engineering Academy(EA)** Engineering Academy is a programme taken along with our diplomas that aims to further educate us on aspects of engineering through practical experiences   
{: .notice--info}

As part of our introduction to Engineering Academy we were introduced to Git and github. There are several reasons for this introduction.

1. It introduces us to a tool that is commonly used in both professional and hobbyist circles
2. It allows us to easily store and retrieve our projects from any device
3. It allows us to easily collaborate with each other

**Git** Git is a free and open source(FOSS) version control software that allows for seamless branching and merging of source code.

**GitHub** GitHub is is a website used for software development that allows for version control using Git.

Fortunately, I have previous experience using Github and as such am writing this post for posterity.

Workflow - Windows 10

***
For windows 10, I will be using Github Desktop. Github desktop is a programme that allows the user to use a graphical user interface(GUI) to perform version control instead of using the command line interface(CLI)

|<em>Github Desktop vs Git CLI</em>|

I am aware that Git has a GUI interface, however Git GUI only allows us to create, clone and open repositories.
