Engineering Academy, documentation, Github
**Engineering Academy(EA)** Engineering Academy is a programme taken along with our diplomas that aims to further educate us on aspects of engineering through practical experiences   
{: .notice--info}

As part of our introduction to Engineering Academy we were introduced to Git and github. There are several reasons for this introduction.

1. It introduces us to a tool that is commonly used in both professional and hobbyist circles
2. It allows us to easily store and retrieve our projects from any device
3. It allows us to easily collaborate with each other

Fortunately, I have experience using Github and as such am writing this post for posterity.
