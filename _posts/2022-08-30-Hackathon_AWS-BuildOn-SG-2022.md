One of the most common tasks in a ward is to dispense and deliver medication to patients, which must be undertaken in a timely manner as patients are waiting to receive their medication before going home. Develop a robot to deliver medication from a satellite pharmacy to a desk beside the patient's bed in the shortest possible time without collision. The robot must be capable of autonomous navigation, optimal route planning and dynamic object avoidance using video-based object recognition. A training set consisting of a virtual ward environment simulating the random movement of people and objects will be provided. The challenge will be split into two parts, with participants selecting one of the following key problems to tackle:
