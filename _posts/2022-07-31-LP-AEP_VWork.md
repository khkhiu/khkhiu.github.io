<strong>Introductions</strong>

***
The Asia-Ready Exposure Programme (AEP) supports projects that provide youths with opportunities to gain meaningful exposure to ASEAN member states, China and India (ACI), and strengthening their competencies in building friendships and networks within the region. 

V-Work is a virtual career-readiness program focused on preparing youths from Asia aged 18 to 25 years old for the Future of Work through 6 online sessions in July 2022. Youths will be able to understand and develop career-related tools and skills, meet and learn from business leaders, gain insights into markets and businesses in the region as well as collaborate with youths from ASEAN. At the end of the project, participants will present to senior business leaders based on the challenge statement issued.
