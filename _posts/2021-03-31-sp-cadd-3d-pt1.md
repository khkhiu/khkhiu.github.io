As part of our Computer Aided Drafting module, we were tasked with the following:
1. Design a key chain

2. Design a desk organiser that fulfilled the following criteria: 
  - The key chain had to be integrated into the design 
  - Consist of at least 3 functions, e.g. pencil holder, stabler holder etc.
  - Must not exceed 120mm x 120mm x 120mm

The design of the key chain is standardised throughout the course and as such was provided for us.  We first had to draw an 80mm by 25mm base and extrude it by 5mm

Second, to create the key ring, we drew 2 15mm by 7.5mm rectangles at the edge of the rectangle. A 6mm hole was also drawn between the 2 new rectangles. A construction line was use determine the exact location of were the circle should be placed. The extrude function was then used to cut out the rectangle and circle.

|<em>Making the key ring</em>|

To further refine the design, we halved the height of the key ring, filleted and chamfer the edges accordingly.

|<em>Chamfering the top of the keychain by 2mm</em>|

Lastly, we wrote our names on the keychain and extruded it to 'stamp' it onto the keychain.

And with that, we completed the keychain aspect of our assignment
